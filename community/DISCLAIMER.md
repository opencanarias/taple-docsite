# Disclaimer

TAPLE is in an early stage of development and is distributed without any warranty, so it should not be used in production.

## Semantic Versioning

The current versions of TAPLE, MAJOR number 0, are considered unstable and do not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) strictly. Any change in the MINOR number may break backward compatibility.

The first version of TAPLE to be considered stable will be 1.0.0. From that moment on, semantic versioning will be used as usual.
