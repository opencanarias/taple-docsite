# Introduction

In this first tutorial we are going to learn how to create our first TAPLE network. We will learn:

1. to set up TAPLE nodes using TAPLE Client;
2. to use the REST API;
3. to create a governance;
4. to modify the governance by adding new members;
5. how the approval process works;
6. that governance has an associated scheme and smart contract.
