# Next steps

Once we have reached this point, we have a small network of three nodes with a common governance for all of them. From there, we can perform extra configurations to adapt the network to the use case that is required, both by modifying the governance and by creating subjects that are not governances.

In the following tutorials, we will see how to perform the following steps, which require a more advanced handling of taple:

- Adding new schemas to the governance
- Creation of contracts
- Creation of subjects
- External invocation
