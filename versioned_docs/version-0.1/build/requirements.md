# Requirements

The minimum requirements for running the tutorials are as follows:

* Linux operating system. TAPLE has only been tested on Linux operating systems. In the future, Windows and Mac systems will be supported.
* Internet connection
* [cURL](https://curl.se/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [TAPLE Tools](./taple-tools)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

:::caution IMPORTANT
Tutorials assume that:
- Docker service has elevated privilegies. If you have any trouble with it try using `sudo` or `su` utilities.
- All required applications (cURL, Docker, TAPLE Tools and Git) are in the `$PATH` environment variable.
