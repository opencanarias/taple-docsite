# Introduction

In this tutorial, we are going to learn the following concepts about TAPLE:
- How to implement access control and traceability through approval.
- Not all events necessarily have to produce a change in the state of the subjects.
- To issue event requests, we do not need a TAPLE node but only the identity.
- TAPLE nodes do not necessarily represent persons or entities, but can also be under the control of devices.
