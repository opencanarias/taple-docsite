# Event approval process

The approval phase involves asking the approvers to vote for or against the application of an event. This process can be automated but tends to be manual, as the response usually requires interaction with the TAPLE API, so it requires a user who can interact with it and therefore usually takes longer than the other phases.

The approvers are defined by the governance, so they must possess it in order to carry out the evaluation, otherwise they would not have access to the contract, which in turn is stored in the state of the governance.

The approvers will only carry out the evaluation if the version of the governance that the subject's owner has coincides with that of the approver. If it is lower or higher, an appropriate message for each case is sent to the subject's owner.

The approval process consists of the following steps:

- The subject owner checks whether the event request requires approval by looking at the response of the evaluators.
- If the request requires it, an approval request is sent to the different approvers.
- Once each approver has the request, they will be able to vote, both for and against, and will send it back to the owner of the subject.
- Every time the owner receives a vote, he will check the following:
  - There are enough positive votes for the application to be accepted.
  - There are so many negative votes that it is impossible to get the application approved.
- In both cases, the owner will generate an event. In the case that the vote has not been successful, the event will be generated but it will not produce changes in the state of the subject, remaining merely for informational purposes.

:::caution Importante

It is important to remember that the subject owner is the only one who can force an effective change on a subject. Therefore, the owner, after the approval process, could decide whether or not to include the event in the chain. This would not follow the standard behavior defined by TAPLE, but it would not break compatibility.
