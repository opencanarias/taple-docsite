# Event approval process

The approval process consists of the following steps:

- An event request is generated, either by the subject owner or by another network member.
- The subject owner checks whether the event request requires approval by looking at the rules defined in the governance.
- If the request requires it, an approval request is sent to the different approvers.
- Once each approver has the request, they will be able to vote, both for and against, and will send it back to the owner of the subject.
- Every time the owner receives a vote, he will check the following:
  - There are enough positive votes for the application to be accepted.. 
  - There are so many negative votes that it is impossible to get the application approved. 
- In both cases, the owner will generate an event that includes the original request and the result of the vote. In the event that the vote has not been successful, the event will be generated but it will not produce changes in the state of the subject, remaining merely for informational purposes.

:::caution Importante

It is important to remember that the subject owner is the only one who can force an effective change on a subject. Therefore, the owner, after the approval process, could decide whether or not to include the event in the chain. This would not follow the standard behavior defined by TAPLE, but it would not break compatibility.
